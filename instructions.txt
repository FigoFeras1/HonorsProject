To run the Flask app, the requirements are the following:
    --Python (3.10 preferred)
    --flask, pandas, numpy, logging, typing installed (the latest versions preferred)

=== Steps to run ===:
    1. Open terminal and change directory to ~/HonorsProject/ (/HonorsProject/web_application also works)
    2. For the first option, you can run the following commands
        For Windows:
            'set FLASK_APP=app.py'
            'flask run' OR 'python -m app.py'
        For macOS/Linux:
            'export FLASK_APP=app.py'
            'flask run' OR 'python -m app.py'

        For either, 'python app.py' also works fine.

    3. For the second option, the same commands can be used, replacing 'app.py' with '__init__.py'
    4. Once the app is running, navigate to 'localhost:5000' to use the webapp

    Note: there are three .csv files for use in HonorsProject/testing, but you can use other files if you choose

Alternatively, you can go to the following url to test the application online:
