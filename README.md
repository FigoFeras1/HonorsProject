# HonorsProject
To run the Flask app, the requirements are the following:<br>

Python (3.10 preferred)<br>
Flask, Pandas, Numpy, Logging and Typing modules installed (the latest versions preferred)

## ~~To use without downloading:~~
~~[Click here](http://figoferas1.pythonanywhere.com/upload)~~

## Install and run locally:
1. Open terminal and change directory to ~/HonorsProject/ (/HonorsProject/web_application also works)
2. For the first option, you can run the following commands<br>

### For Windows:
    'set FLASK_APP=app.py'
    'flask run' OR 'python -m app.py'
### For macOS/Linux:
    'export FLASK_APP=app.py'
    'flask run' OR 'python -m app.py'

### For either, 
    'python app.py' 
also works fine.

<strong>Note</strong>: For the second option, the same commands can be used, replacing 'app.py' with '\_\_init\_\_.py'<br>
Once the app is running, navigate to 'localhost:5000' to use the webapp<br>
<strong>Note</strong>: there are three .csv files for use in HonorsProject/testing, but you can use other files if you choose
